## About INT Chain

INT Chain is the world's first bottom up new-generation blockchain of things (BoT) communication standard and base application platform. The ecosystem is specifically designed for easy integration with any IoT protocol.

To both improve and encourage device interconnectivity, we have built an economy driven ecosystem by providing token-incentives through a decentralized TCP/IP based architecture of IoT. This new business model, molded by IoT devices, will support an entirely new ecosystem of the Internet of Things.
