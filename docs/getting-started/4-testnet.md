# Testnet

However there is also a need for validators to test the new version of INT Chain before it can be released to production. And new validators can also use the testnet to practice the validator operations.

## Install

You need to do is to run the following command in the [intchain](https://github.com/intfoundation/intchain) source root before [building or installing](2-install.md) the intchain binaries:

```bash
intchain --testnet
```

## Titans Testnet

You can use the public RPC develop and test your apps.

- RPC: <http://testnet.titansrpc.intchain.io>

- Explorer: <https://titansexplorer.intchain.io>
